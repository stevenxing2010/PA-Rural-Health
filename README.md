# CMS-Data-Transfer-Processing
This repository includes demo SAS codes for data processing after CMS data transfer
After data transfer approved, some processing is needed. Also, to view the data easily, some transformation of the layout is made. In this case, Joel asked to get the counts of services under each individual diagnosis of amphetamine abuse/dependence and amphetamine poisoning and then get the total number of services for these two diagnoses. So a long format was changed to wide format.
